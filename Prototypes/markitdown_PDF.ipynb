      "\n",
      "While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This\n",
      "can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups.[141] Since English\n",
      "data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views.[142]\n",

      "Stereotyping\n",
      "\n",
      "AI  models  can  reinforce  a  wide  range  of  stereotypes,  including  those  based  on  gender,  ethnicity,  age,  nationality,  religion,  or  occupation.  This  can  lead  to  outputs  that\n",
      "unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.[143]\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from\n",
      "the  data  on  which  these  models  are  trained.  Large  language  models  often  assign  roles  and  characteristics  based  on  traditional  gender  norms.[141]  For  example,  it  might\n",

      "Political bias\n",
      "\n",
      "Political bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit\n",
      "political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political\n",
